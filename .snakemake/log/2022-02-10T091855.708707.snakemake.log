Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job stats:
job      count    min threads    max threads
-----  -------  -------------  -------------
all          1              1              1
total        1              1              1

rule all:
    output: teste.out
    jobid: 0
    resources: tmpdir=/tmp

cat chr21 > teste.out
[Thu Feb 10 09:18:58 2022]
Error in rule all:
    jobid: 0
    output: teste.out
    shell:
        cat chr21 > teste.out
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job all since they might be corrupted:
teste.out
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
